# Summary

This provides a general summary of the compilation process from Whiley
to low-level target platforms (e.g. JavaScript, Java, C, etc).  As
part of this, the Whiley Low Level Language (WyLL) is introduced as an
abstraction to simplify code generators.

# Motivation

In constructing code generators from WyIL to different target
platforms (e.g. JavaScript, Java, C, etc) a number of common problems
have arisen.  The purpose of this document is to detail those problems
and their solutions.  In addition, this document introduces the Whiley
Low Level Language (WyLL) which provides an abstraction layer below
WyIL.  The purpose of this abstraction layer is to provide generic
solutions to prevent backends from constantly reinventing the wheel.

By far, the hardest problems in compiling for a target platform stem
from the complex nature of types in Whiley.  This mostly (though not
exclusively) arises from flow typing. Consider this Whiley code:

```
function f(int|null x) -> (int r):
    if x is int:
        return x
    else:
        return 0
```

Here, the type of `x` is `(int|null)&int)` on the true branch and
`(int|null)&!int` on the false branch.  _But, how should such types be
represented on a given target platform?_ Such types are retained at
the WyIL level because they include useful nominal information which
(amongst other things) is important for error reporting and
verification.

The above types for `x` can easily be simplified to `int` and `null`
respectively.  But that raises another question: _can all types be
simplified in some way?_ In fact, the answer is **no** (though there are
useful approximations we can use).

# Technical Details

This document is concerned with the compilation of Whiley programs to
a range of target platforms, including JavaScript, Java and C.  Other
platforms, such as LLVM and WebAssembly are also of interest.  Whilst
each of these platforms has differences, they also have lots in
common.  

The Whiley Low Level Language can be thought of as a simple imperative
language that strips away much of the complexity found in Whiley's
type system and semantics.  The intention is that this captures the
commonalities across target platforms.  We can summarise these
commonalities as follows:

- **Types**.  We assume the target platform provides a range of
  primitive types.  This includes _booleans_, _fixed-width_ and
  _unbound integers_, _arrays_, _records_, _references_ and _lambdas_
  (a.k.a. function pointers or closures).  Furthermore, we assume that
  reference types have a finite representation regardless of what they
  refer to.  Finally, we assume that recursive types are not natively
  supported and, instead, must simulated using references.

- **Value Semantics**.  We assume the target platform does not
  necessarily provide value semantics for all types.  For example,
  arrays and objects in Java have reference semantics.  As such,
  cloning of values is necessary at different points (though the exact
  details are platform specific).

- **Methods**.  We assume the target platform provides a general
  concept of a function or method which can be invoked.  Whilst this
  can accept zero or more parameters, we assume it only supports zero
  or one return value (i.e. no platform we are aware of natively supports
  multiple returns).  In addition, whilst overloading may be possible
  on the target platform, we assume true overloading of Whiley types
  is not possible.  As such, a mechanism for _name mangling_ is
  required.

- **Statements & Expressions.** We assume the usual range of
  statements and expressions is supported.  This includes
  conditionals, loops, switches, etc.  In general, translation of
  statements and expressions in Whiley to WyLL is straightforward and
  is largely ignored in this document.

We note that each platform supports these features in different ways.
The WyLL is intended to be parameterised to allow for this.

## Types

Whiley supports a wide range of both finitely sized and infinitely
sized types.  For example, it natively supports `int:13`, `uint:5`,
`int:15[]`, etc.  As such, it is unreasonable to expect the target
platform to support such a large range of types.  Instead, a _mapping_
from Whiley types to native types is assumed and is used to guide the
generation of WyLL for the given platform.

The language of types supported in WyLL is given as follows:

* **(Booleans)**.  We assume the target platform has support for
  encoding boolean types (even if this is done using simple integer
  types).

* **(Integers)**.  We assume arbitrary fixed-width signed and unsigned
  integers are supported (e.g. `int:13`, `uint:16`, etc).  For
  example, `int:n` maps to `byte` in Java when `1 <= n <= 8`, to
  `short` when `9 <= n <= 16`, etc.  In JavaScript, we can map `int:n`
  to native numbers upto `n=52`, whilst in C we would map `int:7` to
  `int8_t`, `int:13` to `int_16_t`, etc.  In addition, the target
  platform is assumed to provide a translation for unbounded integers
  (e.g. `BigInteger` in Java, or through GMP in C, etc).

* **(Records)**.  We assume an arbitrary sized record type is
available (e.g. `{int x, int y}`).  For example, in Java this might
map to a class of some kind (e.g. `Struct`), whilst in JavaScript this
maps to an object. **Open Records?**

* **(Arrays)**.  We assume an arbitrary sized array type is available
(e.g. `int[]` maps to `int[]` in Java, and an array in JavaScript, etc).

* **(References)**.  We assume an arbitrary reference type is available
  (e.g. `&int`).  In both Java and JavaScript, for example, this would
  be achieved with some kind of boxing strategy.

* **(Lambda)**.  We assume an arbitrary function type is available
  (e.g. `(int,int)->(int)`, etc).  In Java, this can be implemented
  with some kind of class or interface (e.g. by generalising
  `Function`).  In JavaScript, closures are easily applied.

* **(Unions)**.  We assume a mechanism exists for representing a
  variable which may hold values from any two different types
  (e.g. `int|null`, etc).  In Java we can achieve this via `Object`,
  provided that primitives are boxed, whilst in JavaScript it's automatic.

* **(Any)**.  We assume a mechanism exists for representing a variable
  which may hold _any_ possible value.  Again, in Java we can achieve
  this via `Object`, provided that primitives are boxed, whilst in
  JavaScript it's automatic.

Of importance here are the Whiley types are not supported in WyLL.
Most notably, these includes _intersections_ and _negations_.  These
must be compiled out when generated WyLL.

### Representations

The question of how to translate between arbitrary Whiley types and
the more restricted form supported in WyLL is challenging.  There are
three aspects:

- **Simple Types**.  These are non-recursive types which do not
  involve intersection or negation.  They are the so-called simple
  types because they map directly to WyLL types.

- **Complex Types.** These are more difficult and, indeed, one may
  wonder why the language supports them at all!  Mostly, they exist
  because of flow typing though intersections, for example, can be
  useful in some cases for combining type invariants.

- **Recursive Types**.  These are types which are defined in terms of
  themselves.  They are necessarily rooted at a nominal type
  declaration.

**Simple Types.** These don't warrant further discussion (though
perhaps there are some questions regarding whether or not they should
be flattened).

**Complex Types.** These arise mostly (though not exclusively) from
flow typing.  They are retained in WyIL because they include useful
nominal information which (amongst other things) is important for
error reporting and verification.  For example, consider this Whiley
code:

```
function f(int|null x) -> (int r):
    if x is int:
        return x
    else:
        return 0
```

Here, the type of `x` on the true branch is `(int|null)&int)`.  This
can easily be simplified to `(int&int)|(null&int)` and then to `int`.
Likewise, on the false branch we have `(int|null)&!int` which
simplifies to `(int&!int)|(null&!int)` and then to `null`.


Unfortunately, we cannot always get rid of intersections and negations
through simplification.  After conversion to DNF, we are left with a
union of conjuncts of the form `T1 - T2 - ... - Tn` (where `T1-T2` is
shorthand for `T1&!T2`).  Examples here include `any-null` and `{any
x}-{int x}`, as any further simplification is _lossy_.  We observe
that, for any complex type `S`, there is a _minimal_ simple type `T`
where `S <: T`.  We refer to `T` as the _representation type_ as it is
the minimal underlying representation needed to store values of S.
For example, `any-null` is safely approximated as `any`; likewise,
`{any x}-{int x}` is safely approximated as `{any x}`.  Indeed, a type
of the form `T1 - T2 - ... - Tn` is always safely approximated by
`T1`.


**Recursive Types**.  The obvious way to handle recursive types is to
compile _back pointers_ into references.  For example, this Whiley
code:

```
type LinkedList is null | { LinkedList next, int data }
```

becomes this WyLL code:

```
type LinkedList is null | { &LinkedList next, int data }
```

_The key challenge here is to work out where the backlinks are, and
also to figure out how to manipulate them properly_.


### Coercions

Implicit or explicit type coercions present numerous challenges for
code generation.  Furthermore, the exact requirements for when a
coercion is required depend entirely on the target platform.  Consider
this example:

```
function read(int:8[] items, usize i) -> (int:32 result):
    return items[i]
```

Here, an implicit coercion is placed after the array access to convert
from an `int:8` to an `int:32`.  Of course, the need for this coercion
depends on the target platform.  On Java we need to cast from a `byte`
to an `int` but, on JavaScript, nothing needs to be done.

The set of possible coercions is classified as follows:

- **Widening / Narrowing**.  A simple transformation between integer
  types (e.g. `int:8` to `int:16`, or from `int:16` to `int:8`).  Most
  platforms require such coercions, but the exact details vary.  For
  example, even in Javascript going from `int:8` to `int` requires an
  explicit coercion.

- **Reordering**. A simple transformation between record types
  (e.g. `{int x, int y}` to `{int y, int x}`).  Not all platforms
  require such coercions.  For example, in JavaScript objects are
  dictionaries and, hence, are order agnostic.  But, in a language
  like C, the exact ordering is important.

- **Opening / Closing**. A transformation to/from a smaller record
  type to/from a larger record.  For example, from `{int x, int y}` to
  `{int x, ...}` or from `{int x, ...}` to `{int x, int y}`.  Again,
  the need for this depends on the platform and, in particular, what
  type test operations are available.  For example, in both Java and
  JavaScript, such coercions are not likely to be necessary.  But, in
  a language like C, they are certainly necessary.

- **Raising / Lowering**. A transformation to/from `any`.  For
  example, from `int` to `any` or from `any` to `int`.  As for opening
  / closing, the need for this depends on the platform.

- **Tagging / Untagging**. A transformation to/from a tagged union.
  For example, from `int` to `int|null` or from `int|null` to `int`.
  On the assumption that integer tags are used to distinguish unions,
  then most platforms will require such coercions.  However, on some
  platforms (e.g. Java), it is possible to implement unions using only
  the underlying type test operators and tags could be omitted (though
  this not consider ideal).

- **Retagging**. A transformation between union types (e.g. `int|null`
  to `null|bool|int`).  This occurs when a value in a union flows into
  another value in a union.  The need for such coercions, again,
  depends as above for tagging / untagging.

The implementation of coercions at the WyLL level assumes only a
primitive operator for converting integer types (e.g. between an
`int:8` and an `int:16`, etc), and three operators on unions (tagging,
untagging and testing).  All other coercions are implemented
using existing WyLL types, statements and expression (though in some
cases, it may be preferable to override this).  The following examples
attempt to clarify this somewhat:

**Unions.**  Consider the following Whiley code:

```
function f(int[]|null narr) -> (int[] r):
   if narr is int[]
      return narr
   else:
      return []
```

This would generate (roughly) the following WyLL code:

```
int[] f_u2ain(int[]|null narr) {
  if(narr ?= 0) { return narr#0; }
  else { return []; }
}
```

Here, the tag test operator `?=` simply returns the value of the tag,
whilst the untag operator `e#c` coerces the payload into the given
type.

**Arrays.** These are more complex because they necessarily require
the construction of a new array.  The following illustrates:

```
function f(int:8[] xs) -> (int:16[] ys):
    return xs
```

This would generate (roughly) the following WyLL code:

```
int:16[] f_ai(int:8[] xs) {
   return cast$1(xs);
}

int:16[] cast$1(int:8[] xs) {
  int:16[] ys = [0; |xs|]
  for(int i=0;i!=|ys|;++i) {
    ys[i] = (int:16) xs[i];
  }
  return ys;	
}
```

Observe that on platforms where, for example, `int:8` has the same
representation as `int:16`, the above coercion is unnecessary.  The
given type mapping then prevents the coercion from being created as
the Whiley type `int:8` would map to the WyLL type `int:16`, etc.

**Records.** These are relatively straightforward using a record
  initialiser.  The following illustrates:

```
function f({int:8 x} rec) -> ({int:16 x} res):
    return rec
```

This would generate (roughly) the following WyLL code:

```
{int:16 x} f_ri1x({int:8 x} rec) {
   return { x: (int:16) rec.x };
}
```

Again, the primitive integer coercion operator `(int:16)` is used as
the fundamental building block.

## Multiple Returns

No target platform that we're aware of natively supports multiple
returns (though, potentially, something like LLVM might).  Therefore,
multiple returns are compiled away when generating WyLL and this is
relatively straightforward.  For assignments it's really easy, for
multiple returns it's _slightly_ harder (to do well).

**Multiple Assignments**.  Consider a multiple assignment like this:

```
int x, int y, int z 

x,y,z = 1,f()
```

Here, `f()` returns two `int`s.  The obvious translation is this:

```
x = 1
{int f1, int f2} tmp = f()
y = tmp.f1
z = tmp.f2
```

_Obviously, we need to be careful about the variable name introduced
to prevent clashes._

**Multiple Returns**.  These can be handled in exactly the same way
  above by reusing the declared returns.  However, we might want
  something neater in some cases.  For example, we could translate
  this:

```
return x,y
```

into this:

```
return {x: x, y: y}
```

But, of course, we can't do that with an actual multiple return.
Therefore, this:

```
return x,f()
```
becomes this:

```
{int f1, int f2} tmp = f()
return x, tmp.f1, tmp.f2
```

_However, care needs to be taken for side-effecting expressions as
these must still be evaluated in the correct order._
